### ðŸŒµ Hello ðŸŒœ

I'm **Sam**, a British programmer, composer and CS student.

I like Dungeon Synth, Java, the American West and cybersecurity.

If I can somehow find a job that incorporates all four of these I'll be on my way.

Go to my repos for a mix of uni assignments, personal projects and (soon) collabs.

When I'm not studying or coding I make [Folk tunes](www.aparanoidking.bandcamp.com), edit [radio docs](www.mixcloud.com/samuelcommander) and take [polaroids](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-hWgkspDnW/).
