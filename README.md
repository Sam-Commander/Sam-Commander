### ðŸŒµ Hello ðŸŒœ

I'm **Sam**, a British programmer, music producer and CS student.

I like Java, Android Dev and Dungeon Synth.

A day that involves all four is a good day.

Go to my repos for a mix of uni assignments and personal projects.

When I'm not studying or coding I make [Folk tunes](https://www.aparanoidking.bandcamp.com).
