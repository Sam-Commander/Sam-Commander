### ðŸŒµ Hello ðŸŒœ

I'm **Sam**, a British programmer, music producer and CS student.

I like Java, Dungeon Synth, Android Dev and the American West.

A day that involves all four is a good day.

Go to my repos for a mix of uni assignments, personal projects and (soon) collabs.

When I'm not studying or coding I make [Folk tunes](https://www.aparanoidking.bandcamp.com), edit [radio docs](https://www.mixcloud.com/samuelcommander) and take [polaroids](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-hWgkspDnW/).
